# Magisk Module Systemless Customized Pixel Launcher

## Systemless_CPL
Packaged in a Magisk module, with the addition of priveleged permissions config for correct work as a system application starting from OS 9+.
Not included RecentsProvider (Recents). Put on top of the original Pixel Launcher or any other Recents that suits you best.
For the reason above, i did not replay the pre-installed Lanchers, because we are losing the Recent ones.
We install the module, reboot, go to Settings> Applications> Default applications> Home screen (Desktop)> CPL
You can also download CPL_Feed_Plugin.apk for the Google Discover Assistant through Launcher Settings or install it from the module's home directory after installing the module itself.
Path: /data/adb/modules/CPL/CPL_Feed_Plugin.apk

### !Warnings!
- Launcher not included RecentsProvider
- Don't kill your system Launcher
